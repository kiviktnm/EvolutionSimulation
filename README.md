# Evolution Simulation

EvolutionSimulation is a agent based model for simulating evolution.
This program simulates organisms in three different changing
environments. The organisms are divided into two types, plants and
animals.  Each organism tries to reproduce by gaining enough energy
for doing that. Reproduction is asexual and every time an organism
reproduces there is a set chance for the organism mutating changing
the values of its properties.

In the school project I've written about this program I refer to
plants as producers (tuottajat) and animals as consumers (kuluttajat).
While those terms are more accurate, I will use the terms plants and 
animals here because I believe that those terms introduce more clarity 
to what the two types of organisms do.
